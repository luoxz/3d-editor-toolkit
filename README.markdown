Any ideas, help or wishes is welcome!

**In Downloads section is older video. I need to update it.**

### Implemented features

* Vertex, Edge, Triangle manipulation (move, rotate, scale)
* Edge turning and splitting
* Vertex and mesh merging
* Merge vertex pairs (good for mirrored models)
* Cube, cylinder, sphere primitives
* Save and load

* Vertex and mesh splitting
* Background image for each view different
* Tubing and extrusion
* Import and export for various formats like: OBJ, 3DS, ASE, COLLADA, Blender, MilkShape 3D, and many more...
* More features related to game development and level editing
* And more...

### World manipulation

* Alt + middle mouse => Rotate world
* Middle mouse => Pan world
* Mouse wheel => Zoom world
